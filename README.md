## Overview

The code supports moral score prediction from multiple perspectives (e.g., first-person and third-person) by switching the imported agent module.

## File Description

- `test/moral_judge.py`  
  Performs moral judgment scoring under different perspectives.  
  Perspective switching can be achieved by modifying the imported agent.  
  File paths can be adjusted to test different datasets.

- `result.py`  
  Merges the first-person and third-person evaluation results into a single file for comparison.

- `metric.py`  
  Implements the evaluation metrics.  
  The input files are generated by `result.py`.

## Usage

Please modify the file paths and agent imports in the scripts according to the evaluation setting.
